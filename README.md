# Texas-Hold-Em
A single player text-based version of Texas-Hold-Em

The object of this project is to make a fully functioning single-player version of the poker game, Texas Hold-Em. It is a personal project
that I decided to make using my free time. It is far from complete, however, as there are a lot of things left to do regarding the computer
players, as well as some bugs that I need to work through.
